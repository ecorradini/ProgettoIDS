You try to connect
You get a callback indicating it is connected
You discover services
You are told services are discovered
You get the characteristics
For each characteristic you get the descriptors
For the descriptor you set it to enable notification/indication with BluetoothGattDescriptor.setValue()
You write the descriptor with BluetoothGatt.writeDescriptor()
You enable notifications for the characteristic locally with BluetoothGatt.setCharacteristicNotification(). Without this you won't get called back.
You get notification that the descriptor was written
Now you can write data to the characteristic. All of the characteristic and descriptor configuration has do be done before anything is written to any characteristic.
